# garage-door

A Blazor based Garage Door controller hosted on a Raspberry Pi

I maintain this project with two aims in mind.  Firstly to build something useful so that I can justify the time and effort to maintain this - always helps placate one's better half.  And seccondly to delve into the possibility of building a full stack web app without the need for any JS or any of its variants.

The stack is an ASP.Net Core backend with a Blazor frontend built as a Web Assembly. Blazor is a nascent front end framework from Microsoft that enables you to leverage .Net and C# to build web apps including Single Page Apps.  So basically it directly competes with ReactJS + its associated backends and Angular.

Using C# for client-side web development has some key advantages espcially for .Net developers. It's robust and mature language.  Enabling C# on the client would allow teams to use a common technology stack on server and client.  And Blazor let's you share models between frontend and backend.

The Tech Stack for this project is:
* ASP.Net Core v3.x
* Blazor Web assembly
* Raspbian OS
